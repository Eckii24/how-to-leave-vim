If you try to type, Vim will behave in a way you will not expect.

To actual type, change to INSERT mode.
This can be done with: i

To go back to NORMAL mode press ESC.

The mouse is most of the time useless in vim.
That's a good thing! You can save the time moving your hand from
the keyboard to the mouse.

If you want to select a pice of text, you have to change to VISUAL mode.
This is done with: v

Last but not least, there is the COMMAND mode.
Here you can execute certain command on the whole text.
